This concept explains why your ML model performs poorly â€” it helps you debug models and avoid overfitting or underfitting.


what is bias and variance:

Bias:Model is too simple â†’ doesnâ€™t learn well (underfitting)
Variance:Model is too complex â†’ learns noise â†’ poor on new data (overfitting)

ðŸ“Š Example:

Model	                  Bias	        Variance
y = mx + b (line)	High bias	Low variance
y = crazy curve	        Low bias	High variance

 Goal:
Balance between bias and variance for best performance.
This is called the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.

simple visual:

ðŸŽ¯ High Bias: All arrows in one wrong corner â€” too far from truth

ðŸŽ¯ High Variance: Arrows scattered all over â€” no consistency

âœ… Balanced: Arrows near center â€” accurate and stable model

ðŸ§  Rule of Thumb:

Problem Type	 Likely Cause	      Solution

Always wrong	 High bias	     Use complex model / add features
Good on train,   High variance	     Regularization / more data
bad on test
